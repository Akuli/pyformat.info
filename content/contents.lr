intro:

Python has had awesome string formatters for many years but the documentation on them is far too theoretic and technical.

With this site we try to show you the most common use-cases covered by the [% (also called "mod")](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-formatting) and [.format()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#string-formatting) style string formatting API with practical examples.
All examples on this page are annotated to show which version of Python they work with. The big majority work with all "current" versions of Python - that is Python 2.7 and 3.2 - 3.6.

If you want to contribute more examples, feel free to open an issue or create a pull-request on [GitHub](https://github.com/ulope/pyformat.info)!
